# Pendulum Simulation
A simple pendulum simulation made using Python with Numba. I plan to add drag in the future instead of just damping.

This project simulates a simple pendulum and then graphs the angle relative to the vertical axis compared to time using matplotlib.

# To get it running
Install Python and Pip and then run the following commands in your command line:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Callum-Irving/pendulum-simulation`
2. Change directory into the repository using `cd pendulum-simulation`
3. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. And run using `python pendulum_simulation.py`
